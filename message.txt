Hi Jennifer,

I recently applied for the Front End position through LinkedIn.  I notice that you are a Head of Engineering at Facebook. While I am not sure if you are the right person to contact, here are three reasons why I can provide value to Facebook and your users:

1. Ruby, Python, Javascript, and React are among my strongest technologies and I am confident in my ability to implement them as a software engineer at Facebook and hit the ground running.
2. Having great teamwork, I worked closely with partners in completing daily projects during my time at App Academy, a 1000 hour, 12 week web development course.
3.  I pride myself on my work ethic, ability and will.

Facebook interests me because building relationships.

I know you are a busy person, but I would love the opportunity to have a 10 minute chat on Skype/hangout about the role or other roles the team is recruiting for.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Terrence Tang
