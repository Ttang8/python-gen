Hi Sam,

I recently applied for the Full Stack Developer position through angel list.  I notice that you are a recruiter at Yelp. While I am not sure if you are the right person to contact, here are three reasons why I can provide value to Yelp and your users:

1. Ruby, Python, and Javascript are among my strongest technologies and I am confident in my ability to implement them as a software engineer at Yelp on day one.
2. 
3. 

Yelp interests me because I believe in using technology to drive better planning decisions.

I know you are a busy person, but I would love the opportunity to have a 10 minute chat on Skype/hangout about the role or other roles the team is recruiting for.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Terrence Tang
